This is the dataset of Choi-Williams distribution-based time-frequency images of 13 LPI radar waveforms.

The dataset presents 13 LPI radar waveform with 31 SNR levels, from -20 dB to +10 dB, with the step size of 1 dB.
There are 1000 signals/waveform/SNR, where each signal is transformed to a gray-scale image with the size of 50x50.
In the dataset, 13 folders are corresponding to 13 waveform classes: Rectangular, Barker, Costas, Frank, LFM, P1, P2, P3, P4, T1, T2, T3, and T4.
The details of radio transmission channel can be found in the original dataset paper.
